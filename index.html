	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<article>
	<p>Hi my name is Nate Jahnke and I just started the U of MN Coding Bootcamp this week. I am excited to learn how to make websites and web apps.</p>
	
	<p>I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Surround yourself with angels. We the best. Fan luv. Eliptical talk. We the best. Mogul talk. I’m up to something. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Fan luv. Wraith talk. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender.</p>
