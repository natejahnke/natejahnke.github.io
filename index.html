			<p>Hi my name is Nate Jahnke and I just started the U of MN Coding Bootcamp this week. I am excited to learn how to make websites and web apps.</p>
		
			<p>I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Surround yourself with angels. We the best. Fan luv. Eliptical talk. We the best. Mogul talk. I’m up to something. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Fan luv. Wraith talk. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender.</p>

			<p>Another one. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! They don’t want us to eat. How’s business? Boomin. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it.</p>
			<p>They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Fan luv. Congratulations, you played yourself. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! Surround yourself with angels. Eliptical talk. How’s business? Boomin. Bless up. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat.</p>
